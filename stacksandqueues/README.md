# Stacks & Queues
## Introduction
We may access a random element by index in Array. However, we might want to restrict the processing order in some cases.
Two different processing orders can be used, First-in-First-out and Last-in-First-out and its two corresponding linear data structures, Queue and Stack.

## Queue
In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be processed first.
The insert operation is also called enqueue and the new element is always added at the end of the queue. The delete operation is called dequeue. You are only allowed to remove the first element.
